# Digit-Recognition

Welcome to my MNIST digit recognition project! I've combined the computer vision, deep learning, and interactive user interface design to create a robust digit recognition system.

Utilizing the MNIST dataset, I've trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately recognize handwritten digits. But what sets this project apart is its interactive element â€“ I've created a window using Pygame where users can draw digits directly.

Here is an example of what the user sees:

Computer vision techniques are employed to recognize and preprocess the user-drawn digits before they are fed into the CNN model for prediction. This seamless integration of computer vision and deep learning enables real-time digit recognition with high accuracy.

To facilitate data manipulation and preprocessing, I've leveraged the power of Pandas and NumPy. For model development, training, and testing, I've utilized Keras and TensorFlow.

By bringing together these technologies, I've created a user-friendly application that showcases the capabilities of machine learning in recognizing handwritten digits.
